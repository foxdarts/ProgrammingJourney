# #string concatenation(putting strings together)


# vtuber = "foxdarts" #creates a variable for vtuber. yes this is a youtube chanel run by me as well.. gaming stuff is fun lol


# print("subscribe to " + vtuber) #basic and just prints

# print("subscribe to {}".format(vtuber)) #another great way to print the same information with a little more context puts vtuber info into the curly braces

# print(f"subscribe to {vtuber}") #and you guessed it. another way to print the same info. adds format before and places variable into curly braces.
